I am an undergrad, aspiring PhD, at UC San Diego studying Political Science Data Analytics (B.S) and Computational Social Science. I am working at [The Institute of Cyber Archoelogy and Sustainability](http://ccas.ucsd.edu/) as a Computational Social Science intern. Previously, I have interned as a Policy Analyst at the [San Diego County Taxpayers Association](https://www.sdcta.org/), a Research Assistant for [Dr. Umberto Mignozzetti](https://polisci.ucsd.edu/people/faculty/faculty-directory/currently-active-faculty/mignozzetti-profile.html) and [Nathan Mariano (PhD Candidate)](https://polisci.ucsd.edu/grad/current-students/index.html), a Product Analyst at U.S. News & World Report, and a Legislative Intern for the County of San Diego. I will soon be publishing my first two studies: applied artifical intelligence for urban planners and machine learning for quantifying and visualizing bias in news.

My academic focus is on Misinformation, Policy-Making, Political Methodology, Data Science, Text as Data, and Artificial Intelligence.
